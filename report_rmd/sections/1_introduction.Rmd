# Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of “big data” sources in official statistics (Daas et al., 2015). The ever-growing number of sensors in electronic devices generate large amounts of individual digital tracks, both with a high frequency and at a fine spatial resolution. As a result, there is a high potential in combining these data with traditional official statistics sources, like surveys or administrative data (Cheung, 2012). Such combination could reduce delays in access to relevant information (e.g. short-term economic circumstances), enable the production of information at a more disaggregated level, and reduce data collection costs.

Due to their ubiquitous use in general population, data generated by mobile communication technologies appear as a high potential source for official statistics. For each mobile event, a timestamp and a location are collected. The aggregation of all these events provides information on population distribution, with fine-level spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, mobile phone data have been used with success in various applications. In particular, they appear as a major new data source for traditional fields of study of human and social behavior, such as mobility patterns (Calabrese et al., 2013), modes of transport (Demissie et al., 2016), and the analysis of social and spatial segregation (Galiana et al., 2018). 

Due to their dynamic nature, mobile phone data provide the opportunity to proceed to *present* population counts (in a given venue, city, region...) whereas official statistics sources, notably census data, mostly produce information on *resident* population (Terrier, 2009). Yet, information on the evolution of present population evolution over time has potential use for a wide variety of actors. It provides knowledge on changes in population densities which are due to tourism (Vanhoof et al., 2017) and national or international migration flows (Hugues et al., 2016). It it used to study attendance patterns of particular areas, which are useful to analyze territorial dynamics (Toole et al., 2012). Such temporal variations also appear very important for local and regional actors, who seek to adapt supply of local services (transport, emergency, etc.) to demand.

Multiple challenges arise with the use of mobile phone data for official statistics. The most obvious one is the necessity to ensure confidentiality of collected data by avoiding possibility to identify individuals. Another difficulty is to proceed the huge amounts of data collected by mobile phone, which requires specific and robust IT infrastructures. In this study, we are tackling another important challenge : the geographical location of events. In most applications involving mobile phone data, only the location of the antenna to which a device has connected to is available, leaving the exact geographical location of mobile devices unknown. As a result, researchers working on population estimation using mobile phone data often rely on the Voronoi tessellation approximation (Okabe et al., 2009) : when a phone event is observed, it is assumed that the device connects to the nearest antenna (see for instance Deville et al., 2014 ; Vanhoof et al., 2018). However, there are many downsides to using this hypothesis to estimate the geographical location of events (Ricciato et al., 2015). These shortcomings have the potential to cause important bias in studies relying on this hypothesis. 

The purpose of this report is to provide new estimates of present population in France based on an improved method for geographical detection of mobile phone users. First, we present a probabilistic method for the detection of devices location based on a bayesian model (Tennekes, 2018). Various data sources can be mobilized as prior information to take into account the unequal probabilities of human presence on French territory. Then, we implement this model on an extensively studied data set consisting in call detail records (CDR) of french MNO Orange customers in 2007. Data on land use is mobilized as prior information. We provide evidence that our method improves population densities estimation by comparison with our validation dataset (localized tax data). Finally, we make use of a recent dataset consisting in signalling data from Orange customers to provide an experimental indicator of present population.
