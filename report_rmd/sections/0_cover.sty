Due to their ubiquitous use in general population, mobile phone data appear as a high potential source for official statistics. They provide information on human behaviour with fine-level spatial and temporal resolution, allowing applications such as the measurement of present population. Yet, using mobile phone data for population estimation raises an important difficulty : when a phone event is recorded, only the location of the antenna to which the device has connected is available, leaving the exact geographical location of the user unknown. As a result, researchers using mobile phone data to study human behaviour generally model antennae coverage by a Voronoi tessellation. However, there are many downsides to relying on this approximation, which can substantially skew population estimation. In this study, we implement a bayesian model to improve the estimation of population. Prior information based on land use data is added, which allows the localization of phone users to depart from the Voronoi based one. The model is estimated using a dataset of phone events from around 18 million customers of a French major operator. Validation is performed by comparing population estimates to French localized tax data. Using multiple metrics, we provide evidence that the bayesian model substantially improves population counts as compared to previous estimates. Yet, we show that the gain in quality mainly occurs in rural and peri-urban areas, whereas densely populated areas remain poorly estimated. Overall, our results highlight the great potential of combining mobile phone data with sources of official statistics to complement traditional methods of population estimation.
